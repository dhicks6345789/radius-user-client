# RADIUS User Client

A cross-platform client application to tell a RADIUS server the current user on a machine.

## What This Application Is For

This is a small client-side application, intended to run on workstations in a managed network environment (maybe a school or office setup), where those workstations might be used by multiple users during a typical day. It aims to periodically update a central RADIUS server with the username of the current user using a device.

This application is intended for use by managers of corporate networks with devices shared between users. It probably isn't going to be much use for personal devices, and will more probably be rolled at as part of a managed network's software deployment process. It is open source, so you are free to examine and tinker with the source code if you want, which might prove useful to some people.
